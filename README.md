# DGADetector

DGADetector is a prototype tool used to detect Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA). DGA are used by malicious actors to evade blacklists by randomly creating and registering thousands of domains to use on a daily basis. This makes it very difficult to stay up to date blocking the domains manually. Blocking a good number of these domains can only be done automatically. This weekend I built a python script to analyze various aspects of a given domain and given an estimate on if it is a DGA created domain.
